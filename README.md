## About

To support a more expansive usage of the Git object database — as is the goal for other projects within the [`git-ents`](https://github.com/git-ents) organization — new tooling is needed.
This project aims to add support for local-first Git template infrastructure: issues, reviews, and releases, all stored inside the repository itself.

You may see the terms *porcelain* and *plumbing* used across this project.
These are [borrowed from Git itself](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain): porcelain refers to user-facing commands, and plumbing refers to the lower-level libraries and commands they are built on.
